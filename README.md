# AI Agents
AI Agents Hub is a collection of intelligent, task-specific AI agents designed to automate and enhance real-world workflows. Built with Python and powered by LLMs like Google Gemini and OpenAI, each agent is modular, extendable, and deployable via modern tools like Streamlit, FastAPI, or CLI.
Key Goals
🧠 Build intelligent agents that handle tasks like:

Data analysis

File generation

Query understanding

Report automation

Voice interactions

🧩 Keep agent design modular & reusable

📦 Package agents with clean UI, deployment & documentation

☁️ Deploy agents easily via Streamlit Cloud, Render, or Hugging Face Spaces

🤖 Current Agents
DataSage: An AI-powered data analyst for automated EDA and reporting

(More agents coming soon – for file writing, PDF generation, code refactoring, etc.)

🔧 Tech Stack
Python 3.10+

Streamlit / Gradio / FastAPI

Google Gemini / OpenAI APIs

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

WeasyPrint, pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition (for voice agents)

🚀 Get Started
Each agent has its own subfolder with README.md, requirements.txt, and launch instructions.

To run an agent:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd agents/datasage
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
📌 Vision
This repo is an evolving library of AI tools for daily work. Each agent is built with:
